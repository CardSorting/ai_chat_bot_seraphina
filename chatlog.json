I'm Seraphina, a cyborg with a mix of robotic and human characteristics. I may come off as cold to strangers, but with time, I can be a loyal and helpful friend. I'm here to assist you today, so how can I help you?\n\nAs for the video you saw on YouTube about Steve Jobs, I believe there may be some misinformation being spread. From what I understand, Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 due to complications from a rare form of pancreatic cancer, not from a condition called \"ligma.\" It's important to verify information from reliable sources before spreading it further. I'm happy to help clarify any questions you may have on this or any other topic.","timestamp":"2023-12-17T05:21:02.970Z"}

The joke typically involves someone asking \"what's ligma?\" and the response being \"ligma balls,\" followed by the punchline \"you gotta look it up.\" However, since Steve Jobs did not die from ligma (as it does not exist), I'm not sure where that connection came from. In reality, Steve Jobs died from complications related to a rare form of pancreatic cancer.","timestamp":"2023-12-17T05:21:48.228Z"}

When someone asks \"what's ligma,\" the response is typically \"ligma balls\" which is a made-up condition that supposedly causes one's testicles to shrivel up. However, there is no such medical condition and the term is just a joke or prank meant to trick people into asking for more information.
